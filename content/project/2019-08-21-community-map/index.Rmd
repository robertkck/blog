The Austrian [Digitisation Agency](https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/) commissioned a stakeholder mapping of actors pushing digitisation forward in Austria. The [Community Map](http://robertkck.shinyapps.io/community_map), a Shiny app, shows data collected from a snowballing survey in which key actors identified their main partners and provided information about their R&D, business and data sharing links.
