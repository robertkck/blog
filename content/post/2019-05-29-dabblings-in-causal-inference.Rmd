```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
talent = rnorm(1000)
looks = rnorm(1000)

cor(talent, looks)
```

```{r}
x = talent + looks
skimr::skim(x)
```

```{r}
job = x > quantile(x, .75)
cor(talent[job], looks[job])
```

```{r}
df <- tibble(talent, looks, job) 
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(talent, looks, colour = job)) + 
    geom_point()
```
```{r}
df %>% filter(job) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(talent, looks)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth()
```
