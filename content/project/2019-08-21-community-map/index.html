<p>The Austrian <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/">Digitisation Agency</a> commissioned a stakeholder mapping of actors pushing digitisation forward in Austria. The <a href="http://robertkck.shinyapps.io/community_map">Community Map</a>, a Shiny app, shows data collected from a snowballing survey in which key actors identified their main partners and provided information about their R&amp;D, business and data sharing links.</p>
