<p>Regional technological specialisation follows an underlying time-varying multilayer network of technologies and geographical units hosting inventors. Thus, the socio-technological system is characterised by emergence and inherently hard to predict <span class="citation">(Thurner, Hanel, and Klimek 2018)</span>. Nevertheless, high effort has been put into developing methods for predicting the development of emergent technologies (see e.g. vpinstitute.org/research-examples/), regional technological trajectories <span class="citation">(Farmer and Lafond 2016; Uhlbach, Balland, and Scherngell 2017)</span> and new avenues for research based on existing patent data <span class="citation">(Agrawal, McHale, and Oettl 2017)</span>. Predicting technological specialisation often takes the vantage point of understanding technological development as a meandering movement through the adjacent possible <span class="citation">(Kauffman 2003; Loreto et al. 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>New developments in predictive analytics have enabled researchers and engineers to capture non-linear behaviour and complex interactions to formulate predictions to an unprecedented degree of precision. To apply these methods, the research questions need to be reframed as a prediction problem. These methods require the research question to be reframed as a prediction problem, thus, opening up the possibility to utilize learning methods.</p>
<p>In this paper, we study trajectories of regional technological specialisation in Europe by reframing the analysis as a prediction problem and using methods from the computational socioeconomics and deep learning. More specifically, we use a data driven approach to predict regional technological specialisation patterns based on the REGPAT database. <span class="citation">Mealy, Farmer, and Teytelboym (2019)</span> have shown the equivalence between spectral clustering algorithm, dimensionality reduction methods and the ECI. We add to the literature by investigating graph embedding techniques - another form of dimensionality reduction methods <span class="citation">(Goyal and Ferrara 2018; Cai, Zheng, and Chang 2017)</span> - for link prediction and node classification. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on pre-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph <span class="citation">(Hamilton, Ying, and Leskovec 2017)</span>. Structural Deep Network Embeddings, as one method of representation learning on graphs, is applied to automatically learn to encode graph structure on the bipartite RTA - region network. The results help to better understand the predictability of technology trajectories on this type of knowledge graphs and yield high-precision predictions on a short to medium time-frame.</p>
